**Is your requested platform available as a separate flag when building box64?** *You can check [here.](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md)*
If yes, please write out the flag that is available.

**From which version is this target available?**
This will help me determine from which version is this option available.

**Did you already try compile it yourself?**
If yes, what dependencies and tools did you take advantage of?

What additional steps did you take to make it fully compile?

**Additional context**
Add any other context here, such as required dependencies when building. This will help me make the changes faster.
